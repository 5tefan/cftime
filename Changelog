version 1.1.0 (not yet released)
================================

 * improved exceptions for time differences (issue #128, PR #131).

 * fix intersphinx entries (issue #133, PR #133)

 * make use_only_cftime_datetimes=True by default, so cftime datetime
   instances are returned by default by num2date (instead of returning python
   datetime instances where possible). Issue #136, PR #135.

version 1.0.4.2 release
=======================

 * fix for issue #126 (date2num error when converting a DatetimeProlepticGregorian 
   object). PR #127.
