since version 1.0.4.2 release
=============================
 * improved execptions for time differences (issue #128, PR #131).
 * fix intersphinx entries (issue #133, PR #133)
 * make use_only_cftime_datetimes=True by default, so cftime datetime
 instances are returned by default by num2date (instead of returning python
 datetime instances where possible). Issue #136, PR #135.
